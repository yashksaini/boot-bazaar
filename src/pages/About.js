            <p>
              One of the most important qualities of a good shoe is comfort.
              Shoes should fit well, provide adequate support and cushioning,
              and be breathable to prevent sweating and odors.

            <h1>Durability</h1>
            <p>
              Another key quality of a good shoe is durability. High-quality
              shoes should be made from durable materials that can withstand
              everyday wear and tear, as well as exposure to weather .

            <h1>Style</h1>
            <p>
              While comfort and durability are important, many people also value
              the appearance of their shoes. Good shoe products should be
              stylish and allowing them to be worn with a variety of outfits.
